# FlashStub!

### About:
>  The **FlashStub** service(s) provides vehicles to avoid unnecessary delay in toll-stations by providing with a mechanism to auto-debit the toll amount from their FlashStub wallet when the vehicle (supplied with a RFID tag) passes the toll-station.  
In case the RFID system is down, the toll stationâ€™s person-in-charge can manually enter the amount from an UI which would be debited from the FlashStub wallet.
